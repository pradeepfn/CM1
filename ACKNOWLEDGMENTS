CM1 Numerical Model, Release 17  (cm1r17)
26 September 2013

Acknowledgments:

Many people and organizations have contributed to this numerical model by 
providing code, feedback, and suggestions, or by testing the code on their
applications.  Especially thanked are Peter Bannon, Johannes Dahl, Dan 
Dawson, J. Michael Fritsch, Matthew Gilmore, Richard James, Daniel Kirshbaum, 
Ted Mansell, Marcello Miglietta, Hugh Morrison, Chris Nowotarski, Leigh Orf, 
Matt Parker, Richard Rotunno, Martin Singh, Jerry Straka, Mark Straka, 
Gregory Thompson, Lou Wicker, and Bob Wilhelmson.  

Some code in CM1 was adapted from other numerical models, including:

- The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model
  (land-surface model, surface layer model, ocean mixed-layer model, 
   several microphysics schemes)

- The Advanced Regional Prediction System (ARPS), which is developed by the 
  Center for Analysis and Prediction of Storms at the University of Oklahoma
  (atmospheric radiation codes)

The National Science Foundation (NSF) has supported George Bryan during the 
development of this code through grants ATM-9806309 and ATM-0133506 and by 
NSF's support of the National Center for Atmospheric Research.
